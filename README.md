Taco Libre Party
================

Website for the Taco Libre Party which ran for SG elections in Spring 2014 at the University of Florida. Currently lives at [www.tacolibreparty.com](www.tacolibreparty.com) and probably will until I am told to take it down or the domain expires.

About the Site
--------------

After going through a few designs and WordPress templates, I settled on [Bootstrap](www.getbootstrap.com) with a slightly customized [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) theme. This allowed for full responsiveness (well, after a few @media hacks to make sure everything scaled right.) This was my first effort to ever make a website responsive and, even though Bootstrap pulled a lot of the weight, it was a great learning experience.

I also used [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for the amazingly easy to implement and awesome social media icons (and I definitely plan to use more in upcoming projects.)

Also, as much as I hated to do it, most of the CSS is inline since I came up with this pretty quickly. I may or may not clean it up in the future if this site is needed again.

About the Party

The Taco Libre Party got a lot of press in the Independent Florida Alligator in the weeks leading up to the SG elections. Here are a select few articles:

Unfortunately, Swamp Party [won _all_ of the seats](http://www.alligator.org/news/campus/article_15245d22-99f5-11e3-86e6-0019bb2963f4.html) in the Spring SG elections.
